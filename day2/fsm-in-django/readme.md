# Finite State Machine (FSM) in Django

<https://github.com/calvinhp>

Workflows are super powerful tools for automating business processes online. Our
everyday life is full of workflows such as requesting time off from work. Many
of these are actually Finite State Machines that move from state to state via
transitions. Popular CMSâ€™ such as Plone have rich support for workflows, but now
with django-fsm we can build quick, lightweight business workflows for our
applications. Plus, we have full audit logging and even build visualizations of
our workflow to confirm with the business owners generated from the code.

Became clear early that this was more a talk on FSM's than Django, so left.
