# Time to get real with AI

<https://github.com/HoardingInfo>

A lot of time conversations about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and
recognition technology like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) seem like fairy dust. As more and more of this
technology is implemented into applications, and Python - one of the leading
languages for it. It is important to tie the magic with reality. In this talk,
we will explore the basis of these technologies, the real world applications,
and how to make sure that implementation is useful to the end-user. Expecting
AI/ML to deliver magic to an application can lead to missed expectations, and
poor rollout.

Joined late as I came from the FSM in Django talk

What I learned building a Genetic Alg SDK

- there is almost always an easier solution

What I laread as a developer of doc recognition

- models can have long term consequences
- Models can be easy to create but hard to maintain

What I learned as a product manager of NLP

- data scientists need to think like devs

What I learned as an advocate at splunk

- don't sell fairy dust

---

Lots of cautionary tales about the use of ML/AI.

NLP Days

Data scientists were academically focussed
Devs were lost when deploying and maintingin models
Go to Market was disjointed from end-user reality.

I can _so_ relate to this from my Seeker days.

## Best Practices

Do not test models on truth sets or demo envs
less complex models with larger truth sets are often better
establish experiment framework
don't automate your initial truth set
deep learning! -- be timid
focus on data quality

## Dev best practices

Spend 90% on dev 10% on R&D
Use your own product
build an experiment framework
treat it like any software project

## Go to Market Best Practices

Sell the outcome not the magic
Do not over promise
