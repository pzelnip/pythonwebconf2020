# You want to Kubernetes? You MUST know Docker!

<https://github.com/punkdata>

Achieving velocity is the new normal in software development and release
practices. DevOps teams are becoming more efficient and optimizing their ability
to produce quality software consistently and faster. This velocity can be
directly attributed to the adoption of DevOps and CI/CD practices and the
implementation of DevOps tooling is at the core of these gains. Container
orchestration platforms like Kubernetes are incredibly powerful and companies of
all shapes and sizes wanting to embrace this powerful technology find it very
difficult to find a starting point. Often enough this can be attributed to the
lack of foundational skill sets required to succeed in their Kubernetes journey.
This includes the lack of knowledge and experience with the Docker runtime and
containers.

Having a deep understanding of the Docker runtime and containers is a paramount
in successfully adopting and operating Kubenetes. In this talk Angel will
discuss the skill sets that individuals and teams must develop prior to
endeavoring in their Kubernetes initiatives. Attendees will learn about the
various skill sets needed to proficiently get started with Kubernetes. Angel
will also discuss the critical aspects of the Docker runtime and containers
along with demonstrating how to perform critical actions within the Docker
runtime. Attendees will walk away with a solid grasp of the Docker runtime and
containers that will better prepare them for their DevOps and Kubernetes
initiatives.

Really good, but beginner level introduction to concepts in K8s & Docker.
