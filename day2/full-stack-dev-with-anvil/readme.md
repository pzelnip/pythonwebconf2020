# Full-Stack Web with Nothing But Python: A Deep Dive into Anvil

<https://github.com/meredydd>

The Web stack is famously complicated, with a huge number of languages and
libraries for even a simple app. What if, instead, we could do it all in Python?
I'll be taking a deep dive into Anvil, an open-source framework for building
full-stack web-apps with nothing but Python. That means Python in the browser,
Python on the server, Python for the database - even a Python UI toolkit! I'll
be digging into how Anvil works, but _why_ it's so important to bring Pythonic
values to the full web stack.

Effectively Visual Basic 6.0 but with Python as the implementation language, and with the web as a target.

Left partway through.
