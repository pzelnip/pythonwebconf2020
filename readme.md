Meta thoughts:

- very accessible conference, attendees from small countries
- purchasing a ticket gave a ticket to someone from a lower-income country.
  Super way to encourage diversity and help people who otherwise would be unable
  to attend.
- platform was _buggy_. Hiccups at the start of each day
- too much Plone content
- much confusion on if one should watch on Loudwarm, in Zoom, be in Slack, felt
  like a combination of disparite tools instead of a unified experience
- no break between keynotes & first talks of each stream made early morning a
  bit frantic, esp for those of us to the west of EST.
- 7 talks is too many talks from Six Feet Up people. Would've liked more diversity in experiences from speakers.
- Fireside chat with Carl from Instagram was a standout highlight. Having the opportunity to do informal Q&A with someone who's so advanced was an amazing & inspiring learning opportunity.
- interestingly I found myself interacting in conversations more because it was
  virtual in Slack. Normally in in-person conferences I feel very shy &
  introverted so it's a challenge for me to "inject" myself into conversations.
  The virtual nature of this conference made me feel more comfortable doing so.
- slido was awkward: if I'm watching a talk, I make it fullscreen, so all the
  other widgets like slido are hidden, so now I have to leave fullscreen to post
  my question, then go back fullscreen

The conference itself tried hard to recreate the in-person experience virtually.
I think this is the wrong approach, rather than trying to recreate the in-person
experience which I think is a virtually impossible problem, virtual cons should
_embrace_ the things that virtual conferences can do that in-person can't.
(think that Animal Crossing devops conference)
