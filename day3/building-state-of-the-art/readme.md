# Building State-of-the-art Event-Driven Python Microservices with Serverless in AWS

Serverless is often thought of in terms of FaaS (like AWS Lambda). There are
though many other Serverless services, for instance in AWS there is DynamoDB,
API Gateway, Cognito and so on. Serverless microservices can be composed of
these underlying services to achieve huge flexibility and speed. However, there
is the trap of building a distributed monolith if the right tooling and approach
are not used. At the end of 2019 AWS launched a new Serverless service, Amazon
EventBridge, making it easier to connect microservices and ingest third-party
SaaS as well as AWS events. This talk will go through the steps to build a
state-of-the-art Python Serverless Microservice architecture based on Amazon
Eventbridge through the "EventBridge Storming" approach (an extension of Event
Storming from Domain-Driven Design). From idea to code in 8 steps.
