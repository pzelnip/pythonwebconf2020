# A Web without JavaScript

<https://github.com/freakboy3742>

In the browser, you can use any programming language you want... as long as it's
JavaScript.

But what if you want to use a different language? In this talk, you'll learn how
you can break out of the monolingual environment provided by the browser, and
use Python (or any other language) instead.
