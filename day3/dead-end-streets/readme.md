# Dead-end Streets

Sooner or later, every technological direction we take leads to a dead-end.
Dead-ends aren’t necessary bad things; it can be very pleasant to live at the
end of a cul-de-sac. But, comfortable or not, a dead-end can be hard to get out
of, and what’s more, the more comfortable it is, the longer we’re inclined to
stay there and the harder it is to extract ourselves. This talk is about a very
comfortable dead-end, and why I’ll be sorry to leave it. It’s also about the
brand new direction, how we get ourselves ready for the exit.

Technology is full of dead ends.

What should we do when realize that the technical choice we made is a dead end?

Nothing, because dead-end streets are the best place to live.

Restless Youth analogy

A comfortable dead end is a solved problem.
